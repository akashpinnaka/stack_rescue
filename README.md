# StackRescue

Rails 3 and 4 apps can automatically see Google search results for the exception that was just raised in their Rails logs

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'stack_rescue'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install stack_rescue

## Usage

After installing, you should see output like this in your Rails logs.
Note, this doesn't interfere with better_errors either!
